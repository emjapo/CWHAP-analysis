### Personality (courtesy of Dr. Olivia Newton)

The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) developed by Gosling and colleagues (2003) was used in the study. The TIPI is used to measure the Big Five personality dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Openness to Experiences.

*Scoring*

Responses are provided on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A subset of the items need to be reverse scored: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Mean ratings of the two items for each personality scale are used to calculate scores (see table below).

Recode as follows:
* 7 = 1
* 6 = 2
* 5 = 3
* 4 = 4
* 3 = 5
* 2 = 6
* 1 = 7


| Label  | Item  | Scale |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| TIPI_1 | Extraverted, enthusiastic | Extraversion |
| TIPI_2* | Critical, quarrelsome | Agreeableness |
| TIPI_3 | Dependable, self-disciplined | Conscientiousness |
| TIPI_4* | Anxious, easily upset | Emotional Stability |
| TIPI_5 | Open to new experiences, complex | Openness to Experiences |
| TIPI_6* | Reserved, quiet | Extraversion |
| TIPI_7 | Sympathetic, warm | Agreeableness |
| TIPI_8* | Disorganized, careless | Conscientiousness |
| TIPI_9 | Calm, emotionally stable | Emotional Stability |
| TIPI_10* |  Conventional, uncreative | Openness to Experiences |

Asterisk denotes reverse-scored item.

*Analysis*

Group personality composition can be assessed as a predictor of group effectiveness. 

* Prior research suggests there is negative relationship between the variance of personality scores within a group and group effectiveness such that heterogeneous groups are less effective and homogeneous groups are more effective (Halfhill et al., 2005). 
  * Mechanism: heterogeneity is associated with conflict.
  * Operationalizing heterogeneity: (1) variance of individual scores, (2) range of individual scores, or (3) proportion of team members that posses a trait 
* Minimum and maximum scores can also potentially have predictive utility under the assumption that one individual can significantly affect group outcome. It is suggested that, for problem solving groups, the max score can be used in analysis.
* For collaborative work, it is expected that relationship-oriented traits will be important: agreeableness and emotional stability (Halfhill et al., 2005).

### Virtual Reality Usage

A single 5-point Likert scale response is used to measure VR usage from none at all to a great deal.

### Teammate Familiarity

A single 5-point Likert scale response is used to measure teammate familiarity by asking "To what extent are you familiar with your teammate?".

## Post-test Measures

### Team Processes (courtesy of Dr. Olivia Newton)

A measure of team process was used in the study. Specifically, the 10-item short-form version of Mathieu et al. (2020)'s team process measure was administered to participants in the real group condition. The measure contains three subscales representing second-order team process constructs: Transition Processes, Action Processes, and Interpersonal Processes. 

*Scoring*

Responses are provided on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 1 = Not at all; 2 = Very little; 3 = To some extent; 4 = To a great extent; 5 = To a very great extent. The group mean of each subscale is used to calculate the extent to which the team engaged in effective team processes over some period in time.


Transition Processes 
| Label  | Item  | Facet |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| mission_analysis_1 | Identify the key challenges that we expect to face? | Mission Analysis |
| goal_specification_1 | Ensure that everyone on our team clearly understands our goals? | Goal Specification |
| strategy_formulation_1 | Develop an overall strategy to guide our team activities? | Strategy Formulation and Planning |


Action Processes 
| Label  | Item  | Facet |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| monitoring_progress_1 | Regularly monitor how well we are meeting our team goals? | Monitoring Progress Toward Goals |
| systems_monitoring_1 | Monitor important aspects of our work environment? | Systems Monitoring |
| team_monitoring_1 | Assist each other when help is needed? | Team Monitoring and Backup |
| coordination_1 | Coordinate our activities with one another? | Coordination |

Interpersonal Processes
| Label  | Item  | Facet |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| conflict_management_1| Deal with personal conflicts in fair and equitable ways? | Conflict Management |
| motivating_1 | Encourage each other to perform our very best? | Motivating and Confidence Building |
| affect_management_1 | Keep a good emotional balance in the team? | Affect Management |

### Performance Evaluations

One 11-point bipolar question measures the evaluation of the teammate's performance and one 11-point bipolar question measures the personal evaluation of performance. The scales are both 0 to 10 with 0 being "Awful" and 10 being "Excellent".
